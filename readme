## üõ†Ô∏è Generating a `.exe` with `ps2exe`

### 1. Install `ps2exe` (only once)

~~~powershell
Install-Module -Name ps2exe -Scope CurrentUser
~~~

If prompted, type **Y** (or **A**) to confirm.

### 2. Convert the script to `.exe`

~~~powershell
Invoke-PS2EXE -InputFile "PulisciCollegamentiGUI.ps1" -OutputFile "PulisciCollegamenti.exe"
~~~

### 3. (Optional) Add a custom icon

If you have an `.ico` file (e.g., `PuliziaCollegamenti.ico`), you can include it:

~~~powershell
Invoke-PS2EXE -InputFile "PulisciCollegamentiGUI.ps1" -OutputFile "PulisciCollegamenti.exe" -icon "PuliziaCollegamenti.ico"
~~~

## üí° Notes

- The generated `.exe` is fully **portable** and **does not require** PowerShell to be installed on the target machine.
- The script ignores special system shortcuts (e.g., Control Panel, Run).
